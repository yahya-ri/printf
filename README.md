# Custom printf Implementation

This is a custom implementation of the `printf` function for printf project at ALX in the Software Engineering program. The goal of this project is to collaborate with a student to create a simplified version of the standard C library's `printf` function that supports the `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, and `%i` format specifiers.
